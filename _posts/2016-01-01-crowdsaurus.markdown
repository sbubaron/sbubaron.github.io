description: <p>I participated in my first hackathon late last year, the result, a collaboration with two other teammates was a project based off of the Scribe Project from the NY Public Library. The project provides a means to crowdsource the identification, transcription and confirmation of fossil records.</p><p>While the scribe project gave us a great headstart, the team spent 24 hours learning the API, customizing the workflow and interface and building a better scoreboard to help gameify the process of transcription. While the project didn't win the Hackathon, we did special recognition from the judges for having the project most ready for production.</p>
