description: <p>DoIT decision to migrate to Drupal was influenced by the fact that there were already pockets of Drupal installations across campus. To better serve the campus community, ensure that best practices were followed and to alleviate the burder of system administration, we decided to offer these existing sites access to our platform.</p><p>Based on the projects support capabilities we either assigned the project its own code-base or merged the site into our common, multi-site  platform. This allowed those projects with unique functional and administrative requirements to onboard without requiring a complete IT Takeover of the site, while allowing other sites more freedom to focus on content and primary duties.</p>
