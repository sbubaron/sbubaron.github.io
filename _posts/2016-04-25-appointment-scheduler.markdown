description: <p>When the Teaching, Learning + Technology Department launched its Collaborative Learning Areas, they needed a web based solution to allow students to book the resources in that space. This solution has evolved over time to allow multiple spaces, resource types, regular hours and special hours. The system also tracks and reports usage, incidents, waitlists and cancellations.</p><p>Overtime other various advising departments asked if we could also support their scheduling operations and so the system was adapted to handle the additional challenges supporting multiple advising teams and locations entailed.</p>
